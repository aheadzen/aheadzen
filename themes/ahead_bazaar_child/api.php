Probably this is one of the best days of month that can get you fame and triumph both, but you also need to understand that when you live for a strong purpose then hard work isn?t an option, it?s a necessity. Optimism is the faith that leads to achievements. Nothing can be achieved without hope and confidence.

Some extra hours of toil brings you both wealth and fame today. And you truly deserve it. An informed decision shall help you earn a status that you always longed for. Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than anything else. Your attitude towards life decides what you become. In any case, money and perks are more than good enough.<\/p>","capricorn":"<p>You have tasks at hand and you need to get things done as both domestic and official matters demand your attention. When you live for a strong purpose, then hard work isn?t an option, it?s a necessity. There may be times when your mind is likely to wander (confused?) but controlling and focusing it, is what is going to be a challenge for you. Demands are equally high both in professional and personal front but a little tact will help you handle both the fronts with equal efficiency.<\/p>","sagittarius":"<p>Keep your cool and you shall retain the gains of the past. You may have to draw upon your reserves to do the balancing act between home and office\/work\/profession ? everyone seems to be vying for your otherwise scarce attention. The boost in your self-confidence, which comes from increased support (both emotional and financial), sees you emerge as a winner in all situations. Your emotional bond with your loved ones (especially with father like figure) takes the upper hand over all other concerns.<\/p><p>You are more tuned in to the \"big picture\" and less inclined to worry over details. Others might find you particularly wise right now, and you are more generous with your time, energy, and money. You are now more determined and confident than normal.<\/p>","scorpio":"<p>You never felt so close to your family as you do today. Work and home both seem to be pleasurable for you. This is perhaps one of the best days this month and you are full of vigor and energy. Expressing your love for your near and dear ones would come naturally to you. However, make a note that rights and duties go hand in hand. While you have the freedom to party with your loved ones, you should also pay attention to the tasks at hand.<\/p><p>You are more able to influence others, and you are personally popular in an understated, quiet way.

The day starts on a very quiet note. Secret meetings and hush ?hush talks are one of the few possibilities. There may be some undisclosed alliances (may be unfriendly ones) that could come to the front. Drive slowly or better take public transport if possible. It would help if you avoid impulsive talks and actions today. This is a more introverted period and you might set your feelings aside in order to take care of details now.<\/p>","virgo":"<p>It?s time to work on one to one relationships, as partnerships and business deals are likely today. Sales deals will be the easiest nut to crack (if you are in that profession) as you seem to be a pro now. Your hard work and conviction seem to be your key to success.

Your overbearing aura will leave an indelible mark on people. Although luck and charm are your best friends for the time being, there remains a need to be vigilant in areas of collaborations or tie-ups. Use tact rather than stern and forceful approach to bend things in your direction. Tact is the art of convincing people that they know more than you do. ;)<\/p><p>You could experience some change or undergo inner changes that stimulate a new undertaking, relationship, or attitude change.

Being with people is the mantra and mingling with them is the key to success. Grab this chance with both your hands or you shall rue for not seizing the opportunity.

This will make your relationship sweeter and affectionate. That's what really matters!<\/p>","capricorn":"<p>Both your domestic and professional fronts can be demanding today. A little tact can help you handle both of them perfectly. You may find your mind itinerant and confused, try to focus it.

The point is that when they open your heart to you, they find you attractive and allows them to ?feel? your receptivity.<\/p>","sagittarius":"<p>Just Chill ? is the phrase of the day. You feel strongly bonded to your dear ones, especially your parents. An increase in intimacy is also experienced by you in your love relationship. You may very well get a surprise from your partner.

Your sex will get more satisfying when you let him\/her know that you really like it.<\/p>","libra":"<p>After a very hectic schedule and immense socialization you are now inclined towards peace and calmness. But still this period brings about more closeness in your relationship as silence is the language of love. You know how to play hard-to-get, but how do you get rid of someone unwelcome who keeps asking you out? Try overwhelming them with demands for closeness ? they might just take off running.<\/p>","virgo":"<p>There are chances of working on one-to-one relationships as partnership and business deals are on their way to you.

Your frankness and cheerful attitude is the key to success today.<\/p>","leo":"<p>Love and financial affairs move ahead demandingly. Your imperious sensation leaves ineffaceable mark on people.

Avoid being stern and forceful.<\/p>","cancer":"<p>Mantra for the day is to break the shackles of the past and spread your wings to soar into new horizons. As your work has kept you away from your love, try to spend some quality time with him\/her.  If your instincts say ?no,' then by all means, choose another route. This isn't the day to take unnecessary risks. If your crush isn't in the mood to hang out, then find somebody else. It can be attractive to admit vulnerabilities.<\/p>","gemini":"<p>Together with hard work now fortune also favors you bringing riches, glory and recognition your way. Your romantic front is also pleasant as you enjoy your marital bliss. There are many romantic and rosy moments to come along. Be humble and modest to win everyone's heart. Things are moving a little more slowly on romantic front than you would like, but if you can settle down and adapt yourself to this pace, you might come to like it. Each moment is unique, and you need to get to know each one intimately.<\/p>","taurus":"<p>Now is the time to quit shyness and reach out to the world. If you think you deserve it, go ahead and ask.

People in the field of marketing and branding can witness new avenues and rises.<\/p>","aquarius":"<p>Financially today can turn out to be one of the finest day with all the money and perks on their way to you.  A few additional hours of toil can bring you both reputation and riches and status that you have longed for and truly deserve.

Try to focus on the enhancement of value, make it easier to understand and quicker to implement.<\/p>","capricorn":"<p>Today you have many tasks at hand?and official matters demand more attention than usual. With the current economic climate and companies looking to cut the cost of labor you need to inspire confidence on every level both as an employee and as an employer.

Remember, when you live for a strong purpose, then hard work isn't an option, it's a necessity.<\/p>","sagittarius":"<p>Concentrate on your job and avoid getting embroiled in unnecessary activities. Try skirting the minor issues and stay focused on the major plans and deals. Be prepared to provide adequate service to a new round of customers who might result from expanding your business.

You've got a good balance of home and work going, so be sure to spend some time with your folks. This might just be the best day of the month for you, so take advantage of it.

Expect a quiet beginning to today and secret meetings or other hushy activities throughout. You could be in a position to create an alliance, or an alliance could be forming against you, without your knowledge. Forget your car and walk or take public transportation for today.

If you aren't fired with enthusiasm, you will be fired with enthusiasm.<\/p>","virgo":"<p>Now is the time to work on maintaining your interpersonal relationships. If you're in sales, expect a big deal to come through today which you will be the one to crack. Hard work and your conviction to give your best have helped you to succeed.

The best thing about the future is that it comes only one day at a time.<\/p>","leo":"<p>In a highly demanding environment, your love and money matters will still move ahead, with enough excitement to keep you interested in seeing what happens next. Your luck and charm are your best assets right now, but a need to be vigilant with your groups and collaborations should not be ignored.

Don't be in a rush and carefully consider potential losses and gains for your actions.<\/p>","cancer":"<p>A lack of concentration will have distinct, bad effects on your work or hobby today. You may be considering the meaning of life, or feeling a looming emptiness at large. Journeys not yet taken will reveal themselves to you during this time.

Go confidently in the direction of your dreams.<\/p>","gemini":"<p>Your hard work is attracting success like birthday cake attracts strangers. You will not be disappointed on the emotional front as you and the people around you are feeling fairly blissful. Accept success but remember to take the occasional break.

You feel a need to be with people and mingling is the key to success in many fields. When this chance comes, get it by the neck and don't let go.

You are more inclined to talk about yourself and your personal past now. This may also be a restless time when it is difficult to turn the thinking process off when it would be better to relax! It is an especially fruitful time for any endeavor that requires dealing with words, ideas, and facts and figures.<\/p><p>Your attitude is more youthful, perhaps playful, lighthearted, and non-threatening so that others may be more inclined to turn to you for advice or pleasant conversation. You?ll want to communicate not only with those in your immediate circle or vicinity but with the whole wide world which may now seem to be on your door step. Use the power of words to attract what you want or to further your interests works best for you now.<\/p>","capricorn":"<p>Material gains of several kinds are more than likely. And it's a pleasing reaffirmation of your faith in yourself, of your values as well as your hard work. The dividends you anticipated from all your well-planned and well-executed moves may start coming in faster than expected. But this is definitely not the time for complacency.<\/p><p>What you need to watch out against is pursuing wrong objectives in your workplace\/career, shirking responsibilities and creating confrontations. You may enter into disputes or hassles over all these. Perhaps even with those very dear to you. In short, don't raise a ruckus, either at home or at work. You might merit a rise or promotions, or gain in terms of popularity and credit, in any case so why fight for it. A touch of diplomacy and restraint won't go amiss, and nor will putting your pride and ego in your pocket. <\/p>","sagittarius":"<p>It's an ideal time to pick up information from your environment and the people in it, as your tendency is toward a certain level of intellectual detachment just now. Your mind is often distracted, particularly when circumstances call for you to stick to routine, so this is not the best transit for focusing on one task or project. Your mind is especially inquisitive during this cycle, when learning, short trips, and other forms of communication and making connections, appeal strongly.<\/p><p>Some are fidgety or nervous during this cycle, perhaps due to increased errand-running, phone calls, and the like. Others enjoy the challenge of tackling a variety of subjects. As well, talking, writing, and studying can be good ways to handle stress. Whatever form it takes, the reaching out will be crucial. It will help you not only in your interactions with family but also in your financial and professional dealings.<\/p>","scorpio":"<p>Your focus will be on what is closest to your heart - home and family. Even your career, achievements and intellectual pursuits are viewed in terms of how they influence\/affect your home life, loved ones and family. Your relatives, ancestors, your roots, even the little village you might have hailed from generations ago are retraced. You actually want a true sense of belonging now.<\/p><p>You will embark on a round of dealing with finances\/money in a keen, emphatic manner. Loans, some buying and selling are all on the horizon. The idea will be to have the necessary ready cash for improving the quality of family life by renovation or addition to your house. It would be a wise thing to do. That?s necessary because people who succeed the most have a strong attachment to their roots, their home and their loved ones.<\/p>","libra":"<p>Love and marriage, children and your creativity at work all register gains this week; though work brings added responsibilities that you take over willingly. Communications, imagination, cleverness will be an intrinsic part of you, adding greatly to your relationships in particular, both intimate and professional. In any case, there's also your hugely exciting sense of adventure. I say this despite frustrating hold-ups, conflicts with relatives, siblings\/associates who can't match you and\/or keep up with you.<\/p><p>You find resources within yourself. You reach out, beyond the barriers of self, work, personal gain to a much more deeply involved and evolved existence. In fact, both work and leisure are rendered gay and joyous through sheer high spirits; and there is enough glamour so that ceremony and your public image all make for luck, liveliness and above all, a sense of joyous fulfillment. Inner happiness is all that makes a real difference!<\/p>","virgo":"<p>Your approach to work this week is pleasant, happy, and logical for the most part, unless you allow worry or scattered energy to enter the picture. You are inclined to want to learn new work skills, or to improve your skills and output in terms of work. There is likely to be more activity, movement, contact, and communications with co-workers now.<\/p><p>You tend to take more interest in organizing your working environment and this is an excellent time to do so, as you are especially objective and intelligent when it comes to getting a handle on your daily affairs and all of the \"little things\" that contribute to a feeling of efficiency and competency. Tedious tasks become more prominent. Watch, however, for tension or idle chit-chat interfering with your work output. Productivity is never an accident. It is always the result of a commitment to excellence, intelligent planning, and focused effort.<\/p>","leo":"<p>This week will be full of pulls and influences in two completely different, and opposite directions. What you experience now will be love and hate in equal measure, so also the making and breaking of ties, bonds, relationships; as well as support and cooperation on the one hand and enmity or competition on the other. Perhaps you're confused about how to deal with all these different pulls.<\/p><p>You learn to show more caring, more involvement and maybe prevent a breakup\/separation (not necessarily a marital one) that seemed imminent. In addition, you just manage to disarm the opposition. And it's not just tactics, it's genuine. You do see their point of view and handle matters convincingly so that accord can develop. What you need to do is learn to work in the system; every person is there not for individual competitive returns or recognition, but for contribution to the system as a whole on a win-win basis.<\/p>","cancer":"<p>In your emotional interactions, you focus rather strongly on the physical aspects of love, passion, sex, or certainly intimacy in personal relationships. It makes sense, after all. The excitement generated by more money at your disposal, the sadness over leaving friends\/loved ones behind, if you're moving, all need a release, a form of solace, along with pleasure. In any case, you have a true zest for life ? to laugh and love is a great thing!<\/p><p>And of course, there is better health, without which none of this forecast would really matter, would it? You want to enjoy life to the fullest. Friends, romantic interludes, classy entertaining come with the smooth flow of money. In fact, money does make it all possible. Play and leisure, cozy, warm entertaining certainly helps you do that, so does passion. No two ways about that! But that's certainly not all that will keep you busy and involved.<\/p>","gemini":"<p>The activities of the social circle you move in will add largely to your mental expansion ? perhaps in the input of fresh, new ideas and long-term planning. You may even go on a pilgrimage ? perhaps in a group. An important week! But much will depend on how you use the opportunities that are coming your way. <\/p><p>It is a profitable and good time for publishing, the teaching and academic professions, group activity and communication, long-distance travel (even overseas) and for responding powerfully to great mental and spiritual stimuli. This is very important, and can even be said to be the main trend of the month. Your greatest strength, however, is the spiritual, religious and intellectual awakening that has been building up lately. Nurture it and it will, in turn, help you grow, and probably even outshine everyone ? in terms of both achievement and creativity.<\/p>","taurus":"<p>Rewards have already started flowing in. Don't be drawn into discussions about other people's problems, or into conflict situations, you've got enough to deal with. This is not the time for thrills and adventure, no matter how exciting the friends who suggest it. There could be further anxieties, pulls and pressures. These will almost certainly be work-related, but it could be you building up speed, or \"bunching up the growl\" as you handle them. This could well prove to be both self-defeating and counter-productive.<\/p><p>The pressures continue to be huge, but they are no longer oppressive, since you've learnt to handle them. And gains come to you, in terms of status, power, glory, prestige and achievement. At the least, you'll recognize your own true worth, and rely on your own resources, maybe even set up an individual unit, work from home, whatever.<\/p>","aries":"<p>Widening the vistas of your very existence is what this week makes you do. You still extend warmth and friendship, as well as cooperation at work. In any case, you are now in a mood to make long-lasting decisions and stand by them. You have realized that your staying power and determination are great assets, professionally and personally. You know full well now just how necessary, even vital, it is to work on relationships ? all kinds, all levels, even with your environment, or neighborhood.<\/p><p>You renew old friendships\/acquaintances in this mood. Perhaps there could be a tie or bond, like getting engaged or married; if not now then in the near future. Perhaps even an affair to remember! At any rate, the emotional angle is going be in strong focus. You will look at all your relationships with greater insight, depth and clarity. The glue that holds all relationships together is trust, and trust is based on integrity.<\/p>","pisces":"<p>Creative endeavors could prosper now, particularly those that draw upon the emotions or that require creative visualization skills, such as poetry, art, acting, and other such activities. You are likely to require a certain amount of solitude in order to get your thoughts together or to be mentally productive. You are less likely to chat indiscriminately during this transit, and tend to be a little secretive or tight-lipped for the time being. This may be important, in fact, because this position is sometimes associated with the uncovering of secrets, so discretion may be in order.<\/p><p>NOT a time to go overboard, in terms of self-pity, to see troubles where none exist, or attempt to solve the world's problems. There could be some rivalry, hard feelings generated that could trigger off either of these reactions. A positive outlook is what you need to carry. The positive thinker sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible.<\/p>"}}],"weekly-career":[{"date":"2014-02-26","content":{"aquarius":"<p>Be clear and concise when making requests or otherwise communicating a need or interest.

Others will have a great time tackling the variety of tasks coming up in the future. Whether you find yourself enthralled or appalled, handle your stress by talking or writing with others. Getting a good handle on this will help you well beyond the business front; family interactions also stand to improve.<\/p>","scorpio":"<p>This week you will find yourself focused on what is closest to your heart. Your home and your family will be taking up much of your free time and even the things you do in your career will be viewed in terms of what good they can do for your home life and loved ones.

A sense of belonging is just what you seek.<\/p><p>This is not just a time for personal, private matters however. Your finances and money will need to be dealt with and some loans, buying or selling of items is on the horizon. There could be an especially big purchasing decision coming up at work, or some contracts could be about ready to dole out. It looks like if you do spend a considerable amount this week, it will be toward improving your family life through a renovation or addition to your home.<\/p><p>The people you live with and love are the most important ones in your life.

However, you run the risk of leaving behind people who can't keep up with you, or match the quality of your work. It can definitely be frustrating, but while you're trying to make a better life for yourself remember how difficult things were when you just started. There is a good chance some incompetent associates could become resources with enough prodding or assistance.<\/p><p>You don't need to rely on other people to get things done, though it might seem that way sometimes.

Maintaining your focus this week could prove to be most difficult, so listen to that gut feeling telling you to learn new skills, which would learn to new responsibilities for you at work and, ultimately, new duties. Even if you get no new assignments, improving your output at work will surely garner some support.<\/p><p>Learning new skills is always a good option, but right now you may want to organize your work environment more than anything. This is an excellent time to do so and your objective attitude along with your intelligent handling when it comes to getting a hold on the tasks at hand will both work to your advantage. All the little things that contribute to a feeling of efficiency and competency are within your grasp this week.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, while it will be more difficult for you to keep focused on your usual duties, tedious tasks will become prominent this week. Watch for some tension or idle hands interfering with your work output. Other people are going to be watching you as well, so don't be afraid to impress. Productivity is never an accident. It is always the commitment to excellence meeting a focused effort.<\/p>","leo":"<p>This week you will be feeling the pulls and influences of those around you; at work people will be trying to tug you in two different directions, much to your frustration. You are going to receive love from those people you side with, but an ample share of hate will also come your way. This is the time to make and break ties or bonds and relationships. Because you're being pulled between two crowds, support and cooperation will be seen as well as enmity and competition in equal measure.<\/p><p>Because you're dealing with others so much right now, you may learn to show more caring as well as giving more of yourself to the situations in which you find yourself. You could be the one to prevent a breakup or separation and not necessarily a marital one. You manage to disarm your opposition this week with your genuine attitude and willingness to compromise.<\/p><p>Many compromises will have to be made to make as many of the people around you as happy as possible. You need to learn how to work in the system; every person is there for their own reasons of course, but working together, united, will lead to the entire system prospering which is a winning situation for all involved.<\/p>","cancer":"<p>In your interactions with other people this week, you will tend to focus on physical aspects; love, passion and sex are all on your mind. This seems sensible after all. Thanks to a sudden windfall and having more money at your disposal, you're more excited and that makes you more exciting to the people around you. This may be balanced by the sadness of losing a good friend or compatriot; it looks like you might be getting ready to move house.<\/p><p>Perhaps another good bonus, your physical health looks to be improving. Good news like this really wouldn't matter if you weren't healthy enough to enjoy your good fortune, right? It's no secret you want to get the most pleasure you can out of life. Your friends and family know you're seeking new thrills and experiences. This week's pleasant money flow will keep you at play and entertained as long as you like.<\/p><p>Your good position right now isn't due to luck; your hard work and dedication deserve to be rewarded and now, you're just enjoying the fruits of your labor. Be passionate this week and be open to romantic or purely sexual interludes. It certainly looks good but remember, your leisure activities aren't the only things that will keep you busy this week.<\/p>","gemini":"<p>Your social circle will play a bigger part in your choices than you might like this week. Certainly, input from others will give you fresh ideas and help you to expand mentally. However, putting too much stock into the opinions of others could leave you without an opinion of your own. It might seem unrealistic, but with such a large group of friends you might consider a pilgrimage, whether alone or with your peers. This is without a doubt an important week for you!<\/p><p>With so many people around you, many opportunities could be coming your way this week through your connections. Much of what happens will depend on how you use these chances as they appear. This is a strangely profitable time for publishing so if you have an idea for a book, or have already written something, things are looking up for you. Group activities can leave you with more than you began holding and are encouraged during this week.<\/p><p>There will be many things and people vying for your attention this week. Your greatest strength during this time, which will impress and amaze your peers, is the spiritual or intellectual awakening which has been simmering just under your surface. Even if it seems like you're giving more support than you're getting, nurture this surge of thought and you will grow, perhaps enough to outshine all of your peers in work terms.<\/p>","taurus":"<p>You are noticing a welcome flood of rewards coming your way this week after weeks or even months of tough work, negotiations and compromises.  This is no time for you to get dragged into discussions about other people's problems, or otherwise get drawn into conflicts which are not your own. In order to keep these rewards coming you know you have responsibilities to meet and you have enough to deal with right now, without other snags.<\/p><p>Regardless of how many friends might try to get you to attempt something new or exciting, this is not a good time for thrills or adventuring. Any more anxiety or pressure right now could bring you to a screeching halt, so don't take up more than you can handle even if it seems harmless. Work-related problems must be handled satisfactorily during this time if you wish to keep building speed during this supercharged week.<\/p><p>You feel like you've got some kind of energy which you can't explain. It has a lot to do with the recognition you're getting now for work you put in, in the past. Pressures will continue to be huge, but such pressure is no longer oppressive to you; you know good will come from your hard work and that is strong encouragement to keep you doing what you do best. This is not a bad time at all to consider starting some kind of small, home-based business to supplement your income.<\/p>","aries":"<p>This week looks to be one during which you widen the vistas of your very existence. It might seem like a big, imaginative claim but keep reading. Even while you become something more yourself, you will be happy to extend a friendly hand to those who need it, as well as giving your full cooperation at work on all business matters. For whatever facet of your life, you're willing to make some big decisions now and stand by them.<\/p><p>This is a time to make decisions and make friends and you have come to realize your staying power and determination are some of your greatest assets, thanks to the positive reviews you've been getting from your peers. You know well how vital it is to work on and maintain your relationships whether they be old or new, professional or personal. This is also a good week for you to renew old friendships and see how those people you spent your younger years with are doing in life now, years later.<\/p><p>You will make those renewals, or at least make efforts to reopen connections long closed. Besides that, the odds of forming a new tie or bond are great as well, and an engagement or even marriage could be in the works for you. However things happen this week, you are going to be an emotional person. Taking stock of your interpersonal relations will leave you with some insight as to how you can improve yourself.<\/p>","pisces":"<p>Your creative energies are running at a high this week and any activities or projects which draw upon your emotive state, or which require visualization, will prosper. Skills like poetry or art, anything at all which really lets you express your innermost feelings, will take the center stage in your life this week. While you are feeling so expressive you may wish to avoid others and spend some time alone where you can focus on your thoughts instead of what others need from you.<\/p><p>Because you're spending so much time in your head, you will be far less likely to engage in indiscriminate chat these days. If you must speak with someone else, the only things which will keep you interested are big business matters. This period is usually associated with the leaking of secrets, or uncovering of truths, so it could really work to your benefit if you keep your lips sealed for a while now.<\/p><p>While you are keeping yourself from unwanted conversations, or outright avoiding other people, you should keep yourself from going overboard or making any extreme decisions. You can't solve everyone's problems and doing something drastic without input from those who might be affected is inconsiderate, even stupid during this time. You can see the invisible, feel the intangible and achieve the impossible this week.<\/p>"}}],"weekly-love":[{"date":"2014-02-26","content":{"aquarius":"<p>Now is the best time to go out and grab hold of what, or who, you really desire.  No reason to shy away, tell your love interest just how you feel, especially now when you're feeling things on a more personal level.  This is such a powerful and passionate time for you right now. Even though your time would be better spent relaxing, you're emotions are running high. It is a wonderful time for getting things done, whether it is following through with the ideas you've been contemplating on for some time now or dealing with figures.<\/p><p>Your emotional thoughts delve into your past more so now than you're used to and you are more inclined to talk about it. Use it to your advantage and find that chemistry again with the one you love. Bonding can be easily attainable at this time so be prepared to take your dating to the next level.<\/p><p>Your light hearted attitude will definitely be for your benefit this week. You are feeling more child-like at heart and quite playful. This will tend to wake others up around you and get them to notice you more.  Use it to your advantage and communicate with the world around you!  They are all at your fingertips.  The life and love we create is the life and love we live.<\/p>","capricorn":"<p>You'll be rewarded this week with materialistic (even selfish :P ) sensation. Your increased passion and sexuality as well as your faith, high moral standards and values you have and the plans you have put into motion will pay off nicely.  Don't reap the benefits as of yet, however.  It is definitely not the time for such antics.<\/p><p>Although it will be as tempting as the forbidden fruit, you shouldn't dive into the benefits of your successes just yet. Why not take things to the next level? The prize is yours so you don't have to engage in the pursuit of it. Trying to gloat over it to others will only repel people close to you.<\/p><p>You (or your lover) may not be prepared and ready yet to dive into more intimate aspect of the relationship. Maintaining that fascinating charm that initially attracted him or her to you for at least a week or so might be a good idea. He\/she is already yours. Your reward will still be there when it is time to collect and you'll still be on top of the world. Being humble is good but not without confidence. Add a tough side to your kindness and you will boost your score on the popularity scale.<\/p>","sagittarius":"<p>You seem intellectually indifferent this week.  You are distracted by someone or something that is keeping your mind off what it should be focusing on. You now reach out to siblings, neighbors and even colleagues at work place and discover what you need to get yourself back on track.  You may not be able to focus yourself on anything of importance such as a specific project or a love interest you are trying to attain.<\/p><p>Your curiosity will try to get the best of you. Try to keep up with errands and don't lose sight of most important things or people in your life. If this does not work, reach out and let others help you do so. This time will pass and you'll be able to get back to the matters of the heart in no time.<\/p><p>Whether you find yourself feeling nervous and not able to stay on tasks at hand, or you feel adventurous and like a good challenge in doing so, you'll still need the assistance of others around you. You may tend to jump to hasty decisions or may feel like you're spinning your head over wheels in the end.  Don't be afraid to ask for help.  In fact, it is insisted that you do so.<\/p>","scorpio":"<p>You may have some lopsided ideas about what you can reasonably hold inside and what you ought to risk revealing. Your thoughts will roam around people closest to you as you look deeper into the details of your life. Everything in your life and the influences they have had on you is important to you now. To strengthen these influences is also as important as to cleanse out old junk and unnecessary beliefs.<\/p><p>Your family life, your career, the thoughts you pursue, perhaps even the heritage from where it all stems from. They all play a huge part of what you strive toward lately.  Search yourself, search in your emotions and find the passion that makes it all possible.<\/p><p>Gearing up towards renovations and\/or improvements will play a key role now.  Your goal here is to be sure that you don't loose sight of other important aspects of your relationships. With progression comes joy, and with happiness comes a deeper embedded love, life and home.  Where we love is home, home that our feet may leave, but not our hearts.<\/p>","libra":"<p>What you desire may very well pan out in time. If you're single, you may be surprised if a friend or colleague makes a romantic overture. Your success in love and even romantic creativity are soaring for you. Take on the added tasks that come with it and you'll fall naturally into place.<\/p><p>Whether you are dating, on a business venture or making plans with loved ones you can't go wrong. There will be others around you who will seem to get exasperated at your success but do not hesitate on upstaging yourself because of this.  Keep yourself on the right path and your partner, should you have one, needs to be included in your joyful ride.<\/p><p>Look to yourself for the resources you desire and look toward others for something much deeper. You are ready to find yourself on a higher intellectual and perhaps even sexual level. Spirits are soaring and your world around you is yours to paint however you'd like it to be.  This makes you very attractive and powerful in many eyes.  Use it to your advantage.  It will prove fruitful for you.  As soon as you realize the increase in your own high spirits, you'll be able to expand your love and your feelings outwards and upwards.<\/p>","virgo":"<p>Your professional ethics are heightened this week as you find yourself quite content in your career and accomplishments.

This will find a bigger attraction toward ones you work with, are in contact with or deal with on a daily basis.<\/p><p>If you're in a serious relationship, that anxiety between staying put or walking away has resurfaced. Your sense of responsibility is praiseworthy ? though you may be sticking with it at the cost of your relationships and peace of mind. You're wondering why things in your love life can't return to the way they used to be.<\/p><p>Accept the compassionate time of change and face your relationship issues head-on. Be careful to avoid added stress or unnecessary affairs during this time. Stay focused, committed and on the right path. Your romantic life is not what you thought it would be, and you're due for a change ? but not by escaping from the situation or divine intervention. You and you alone are the architect of a new blueprint for your love life.<\/p>","leo":"<p>Love is a struggle for you this week.  The affairs of the heart pull you in all directions.  The love you sense will be equally coupled with the hate that you feel.  Taking such considerations in stride will help get you through them.    If you are finding it difficult to struggle through, perhaps using the extreme differences in your favor will help heal the cracks in the ties that bind.  A hot sexual affair with your lover after a heated argument may do some good.  Take advantage of the love feelings you have between each other and plan some quality together time.<\/p><p>Regardless of how you deal with it, you will need to balance the support and cooperation you receive as well as the competitive and hostility thrown your way.  Take it all in stride and try to learn to swallow your pride a bit, deal with the problems and heated arguments in a different manner and you will perhaps avoid a break up that seemed imminent in the past.  Taking the blows in a different manner may make all the difference.  Let them know that you do hear them and you do understand their point of views no matter how you may feel about them.<\/p><p>Your strong focus should be in how you handle what you receive.  Understanding your lover will be the ace you need and dealing with these views on a softer level will be your matching card to win the battle.  Just remember, winning the game isn't what the ending result should be.  Working together as a couple is the way to win the entire war.  You come to love not by finding the perfect person, but by seeing an imperfect person perfectly.<\/p>","cancer":"<p>You tend to gear yourself toward the desires and the passions of the physicality of love making. The romantic interludes you put yourself into, arouse you through touch and the excitement you feel with the physical aspects of it all.  Whether you turn toward such aspects because of the intensity you feel with a healthy monetary flow or some down time you feel because of having to leave someone you care about behind, it seems to be an outlet for you to release your pent up feelings toward.  And what better way to do so than in a physical sense of pleasure and solace.<\/p><p>Along with this enjoyment and fulfillment in life comes a better and a healthier lifestyle.

You'll have many opportunities coming into your life and what you do with them will be important.<\/p><p>Combine a spicy relationship with sweet sex and you get to thinking about what it would be like to stay together forever. Diversification seems to be the key to a happy life this month. So forget about trying to be in control of the purse strings, and focus on where you see yourself with the one you love years from now ? beyond the chemistry and beyond the sex.<\/p><p>In all of this new stimuli coming into your life, the most favorable is on a spiritual level. Feel it in your heart, care for it in your life and nurture it in your soul.  It will, in turn, help you to go up, out and above your expectations as well as everyone else's expectations of you.

Steady bonds will be strengthened and paring with that special someone is favorable. However don't take things for granted.<\/p><p>The passion you feel deep within you is real and you shouldn't try to keep it to yourself.  Reach inside and pull it out.  Renew an old friendship.

You'll find yourself in the mindset of artistic visualizations whether it is in poetry, theater or any other form of art.  It will prove positive for you and increase your emotional outlook on your life.  To be able to let your creative passions pour out, you'll first need the seclusion to gather your thoughts to do so. It will prove to be profitable in the end.<\/p><p>Be extremely careful in self pity and looking for a reason to wallow.  Do not look for problems that are not there and do not search for a reason to be negative.  Stay within yourself and don't try to solve the problems of the world.  Low lying conflict could be just under the surface and will more than likely flair up in these instances.<\/p><p>Be positive and only think of the best days.  Understand people and their feelings and it will help you achieving the unachievable.

In fact, you may be somewhat aggressive and have a short temper. Avoid being over-ambitious. Take charge of your life, but don't bully others in the progression! This is an excellent phase for assertiveness and physical liveliness. Love affairs may also be stepped up. On the odd circumstance when an accident occurs, it is more likely to involve the head or face.<\/p><p>You could face difficulties in fulfilling your wishes and satisfying your desires. You may feel frustrated and unappreciated. Your feelings are going against much of what you value, so that too makes way for a possible difficulty. It could also happen that now you?re so busy working for others that you have no time for yourself and in the process you miss out a lot of good things of life.<\/p>","virgo":"<p>Now the focus shifts on people and relationships, ranging from personal to platonic to just professional. You will realize that to help you achieve success your people skills need to be honed. You will need to be sharp-witted and alert in order to identify potential (or even actual) threats to your welfare\/progress. It may not happen but it is good to be prepared. In spite of all this, this month brings you caring and sharing, that is, fine companionship, close ties with loved ones and an overall feeling of both togetherness and contentment. The emphasis is on \"us\" rather than \"me\". This may be an especially busy time for people who consult or work with clients one-on-one.<\/p><p>Closer to home, you will concern yourself with the welfare of bosses and superiors, older relatives and of course, parents and in-laws. Relationships with servants, employees, colleagues and subordinates, payments made, salaries and handouts, even giving to charitable institutions are the important aspects of the money scene. Establishing a happy and harmonious work environment through friendly relations with co-workers or tidying up your work area comes into focus. You could find that your talents or skills are especially appreciated. Romantic and social activities may revolve around your working environment.<\/p><p>You may tend to show-off what you have and own, and you could be trying to demonstrate your worth to others using money and possessions as the means to do so. You will exert extra energy to secure whatever you feel you have earned or deserve. Conflicts might occur over issues of rights and ownership. Some of you might face setbacks in their earning potential, affecting both income and the resources you?ve been able to rely on, in the past. This is a time when impulse buying is at a peak.<\/p><p>An excellent time to schedule interviews, meetings and one to many discussions. You are clear cut in your ideas and presentations\/shows are likely to go well.

Pending matters may come to an end; there could be a death, a legacy causing you sorrow and joy\/relief at the same time. Clearing out psychic \"junk\" or ridding yourself of bad habits may be part of the picture now. You are more willing than usual to explore life's secrets. This is an especially introspective month during which you have the chance to truly uncover your personal strengths and talents.<\/p><p>One-to-one linking appeals to you more than group activities or more casual associations. If single, you are more eager than usual to enter into a devoted relationship. In general, you are flexible when it comes to your affections - very willing to negotiate and make harmony. Smoothing out your close\/special affairs is what makes you pleased. Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.<\/p><p>You may be especially busy serving responsibilities and communicating with others. You may also tend to have a more pushy, self-centered or provocative communication style. As such, discussions may become intense, or they may turn into arguments. If latter is the case, it's likely because you are taking things very personally right now, or because you are deliberately imposing your beliefs and ideas. There might be an issue that might raise confrontations or requires compromise with someone. Extra caution is advised in driving or anything related to transportation.<\/p>","cancer":"<p>Long-distance and foreign connections, exchange and trade will be favored. You'll travel a fair amount and may strike up a chance acquaintance who shares your views, ideals and ideas. Also, you deal with a kind of weariness, even disillusionment, that sets in. A month of exaltation, true spirituality, intellectual and moral growth ? a truly cosmic gift comes to you. The preceding month had lots of highs and lows for you to reckon with. This month reorients you to your lasting values, and greater idealism is the result, in conjunction with heightened consciousness and conscience, that come hand in hand with true and sincere spirituality and faith.<\/p><p>You may feel that you?re in the grip of a force beyond your control, since it is a time for great, perhaps even radical or drastic, changes in your material as well as emotional world. This month, a financial boost is likely, or you may expand money-wise all the way through your partner\/associate. You are more tending to even differences in a partnership\/relationship regarding the sharing of authority, intimacy matters, finances, and other emotionally-charged topics. Close relationships are intensified. Either you or your partner shall demand a deeper unification.<\/p><p>You may work hard at making yourself feel more safe and sound, and you may be called upon to take charge on the home and family front. You may have to invest time and money in homemaking, house repairs, re-decorating or family activities. There could be new beginnings through buying a home or real estate. For some of you, relationships within the family could be a source of tensions, depressions and chaos. Try being helpful to others in the family, and avoid eccentricity as much possible.<\/p>","gemini":"<p>Recognition, rewards, greater power and prestige, even your assets, property, belongings are enhanced greatly. The time is being truly generous, and you deserve it. Your vision is practical right now, and you want to see tangible results for your efforts.

Do what you feel is right, keeping in mind that you are at your most visible during this month in the year.<\/p><p>A taste for the out of the ordinary is favored this month. Regular affairs simply don't seem to satisfy. You will accept pleasure from anything and everything that expands your horizons, both physically and emotionally. Distant connections and places may for the most part appeal now. You have a tendency to be outgoing and liberal when it comes to love. Public relations work, promotion, and other such activities are favored. It is more about how you communicate yourself than the essentials of what you are saying that helps influencing others to you. <\/p><p>You become very gregarious and active in your quest for pleasures. These take account ? on-the-floor activities, hobbies and other creative outlets, as well as sports, parties and social dealings. You will focus on activities that will keep you in the middle-of-the-road. You?ll tend to express yourself creatively, through activities with children, romantic activities, hobbies or sports. You are more playful than usual, and especially magnetic.

You still extend warmth and friendship, as well as cooperation at work. All the trends ? which started last month will now gain momentum, focus and direction. You reach out to people in a rare show of warmth, connubial bliss and friendship. This is a rather happy, goal-oriented month. A lively agenda is promised, you're attracting quite a bit of interest, and your energy for making contact with others is high. This is a time to follow your dreams and ideals, and to plant a seed in the form of a wish for the future.<\/p><p>Your responsibility and authority are likable qualities now, making this an encouraging period overall for schmoozing with those in a higher position than you, as well as for negotiations or social activities related to business. You are most charismatic and well-received on the job. You are socially go-getting right now, and success may come though your good managerial qualities or some form of artistic talent, or, indirectly through your spouse. People who turn your head are those who come across as especially competent.<\/p><p>It's an excellent time to take care of your health. You might decide to change jobs, and if your work has not been fulfilling in the past, then initiative to make changes should be taken. Such a situation left unchanged could easily result in health problems, just as it could to routinely overwork oneself. Undesirable job pressures may lead to depressions and injuries. Your services may be in demand and you could make some important strides forward. A situation on the job or with your co-workers may seem to be all consuming of your energies, and some review may be in order.<\/p><p>You could face difficulties in fulfilling your wishes and satisfying your desires. You may feel frustrated and unappreciated. Your feelings are going against much of what you value, so that too makes way for a possible difficulty. It could also happen that now you?re so busy working for others that you have no time for yourself and in the process you miss out a lot of good things of life.<\/p>","aries":"<p>You will have a sense of awareness of your own limitations this month, leading up to your birthday phase, be they physical, emotional or even financial, as well as a sense of being confined and restricted. There could be some rivalry, hard feelings generated that could trigger off either of these reactions. NOT a time to go overboard, in terms of self-pity, to see troubles where none exist, or attempt to solve the world's problems. It might be a good idea to maintain a low profile and be less vocal. A time to make special efforts to get along with others ? both professionally and personally. Changes initiated now may prove beneficial in the long run, both materially and otherwise.<\/p><p>Forming pleasant, affectionate social friendships, possibly related to activities within an organization\/society, can figure. You may meet someone through such group activities; consequently, your interests will be shared. The bottom line is that sharing interests with someone is what makes you happy this month. This way you can turn good relationships into everlasting relationships. You are more peace-loving than normal, somewhat detached on a personal level and more connected to the outer-world. You will be more friendly, more magnanimous but also more extravagant.<\/p><p>Attempting to satisfy romantic needs and assertive\/sexual needs at the same time could be taxing. Passions run high and you can feel the heat. You could stir up problems in order to fulfill a need for excitement. Be wary of making impulse persuades. Jealousy, greed and lust could all come into action at the same time. Keep your cool!<\/p><p>You are anxious with taking on an important or aggressive role within an association or relationship. You are on the go in pursuing allies and in the forming of new partnerships. You may even find that you seem to need someone's help in order to accomplish your objectives. Your close personal relationships are lively - full of conflicts and resolutions or reconciliations. Be aware of what you and your partner want for yourselves and what you want from the relationship.

Don?t just live your life, do whatever that makes it genuine and whole.<\/p><p>Your sensual being is within you and if you look close enough you may find that you could use the element of change to your advantage and spice up your relationships with near and dear ones.

Get closer and strengthen bonds that are necessary within your profession as well.  Your best bet would be to go with the flow of things while doing this.<\/p><p>A challenge or a confrontation is definitely not in your best interest right now.

Now all of this could also mean you are too busy with your own personal issues and tend to overlook your love relationship for a while.

Effectiveness and priority is always a good thing in reaching your goals and desires.

While romantic overtures remain intriguing to you, you are more interested in proof than talk.<\/p><p>On a romantic level, there are likely to be some challenges, intimacy problems, and certainly a more serious tone. Lack of intimacy or other flaws in casual relationships may seem glaring right now. Use this time wisely to get close to family and strengthen ties among them.

Learn who you can rely on for more than small favors as you strive towards perfection. Be efficient in your work and dealings.<\/p>","virgo":"<p>Your focus in life is shifting to the people around you and your relationships with those people. Your significant other, children or parents should be given at least the same amount of time you give your co-workers, superiors or subordinates, if not more. They are the ones who really matter in your life after all. To do the best you can for them though, you need to be the best you can be with that latter group of people.<\/p><p>You must have your wits about you and be alert at work during the majority of this month. If you have good people skills, use them to build relationships and if you don't, get them. Your need to communicate with others is greater now than most times and to communicate effectively, you need to learn how to deal with others. A potential, or actual threat may exist, coming between you and your position in your business. You must be vigilant as ever during this time to overcome the negativity which may be hurtling toward you even now. In spite of what looks like gloom and doom, you have those people you love to fall back on when this time becomes difficult. Close ties with your loved ones will leave you feeling content to say the least, so let them ease your suffering if it does come to you.<\/p><p>Now is a time to focus on ?us? or ?we? instead of ?I? or ?me?. You have needs, yes, but all the people around you need something from you as well. If you do a lot of work with clients one on one, such as going to meet them at home or elsewhere, you will be especially busy during this time.<\/p>","leo":"<p>The time has come once again for you to demonstrate your skill in the handling of financial matters. Legacies or trusts, in which people you know are involved, will come to involve you as well. This is the time to make a small loan to a friend or ask for a loan yourself if you happen to need a little extra money.<\/p><p>Though you know how to run your money and make it work for you, your health is another thing altogether. You have no control over the length of your life and right now some health issues could be nagging at you. They need to be addressed immediately and not put off a moment longer, so it's time to use that company insurance. Make an appointment with your doctor right away. Certain, pending matters may come to a conclusion and that may just be by a death. A legacy causing you mixed emotions of sorrow and relief could occur during this phase. Pay close attention to the people you see every day and do not be afraid to administer CPR or the Heimlich if you find yourself in a position to save the life of another. Callous as it might sound, what could be more ingratiating than being the one to keep your boss from dying until medical help arrives?<\/p><p>Now more than ever, you are willing to explore the secrets of life. The time to dwell on yourself and do some serious introspection is now; you may uncover a personal strength or talent of which you were unaware. You know what you need to do in order to perform better and get recognized for what you do.<\/p>","cancer":"<p>During this time, you may be surprised by having closer relations with people half the world away, closer than the relationships with the people right next to you at home or work. Long-distance and foreign connections are favored during this time and can do much to help advance you on your chosen path. A fair amount of business travel is in the cards and these trips will give you many chances to meet people who share your views and ideals.<\/p><p>Because you are going all over the world, a world-weariness has the potential to set in and turn you sluggish. A certain disillusionment, with your peers, superiors or someone else close to you may keep you up at night. Do not let these things distract you from what should be a month of exaltation! Grow spiritually, intellectually and morally while the time for growing is ripe. It is as if the cosmos are aiding you in some indecipherable way. Spending time with your spiritual adviser or a teacher from the past would be rewarding. The preceding month had lots of highs and lows for you to handle, but this month is going to be different. Your priorities will be set straight by coming to understand what the people around you need from you every day.<\/p><p>Expect some travel, expect to meet new people and expect a whole new list of demands from each of them. Be diligent in your work and have faith that you will survive any tests. Though your maker may not put more on your plate than you can handle, your employer very well might, so be ready for arduous work.<\/p>","gemini":"<p>Prepare for many things in your life to be heightened, enhanced and made better. Recognition for your deeds and work, rewards, prestige and even some power could be coming your way. This is a generous time but since you have been so generous with the people around you in the past, you deserve it and everyone involved knows it. Allow your peers to indulge you and do not be averse to a business dinner with the boss.<\/p><p>Your vision is practical right now; you know what kind of results are realistic and you expect to see tangible results for your efforts. The people around you know that you do things to get them done quickly and efficiently, and more contact with your authority figures is likely. It's nothing to worry about though as they're likely to be showering you with praise or recognition for your great performance. Whether you are seeking it or not, some added responsibility may come along with this recognition. That is the way business works, but some people would rather not deal with any more needs than right now. It is not a selfish attitude, but if you want to get further than you are right now you need to be more willing to give more of yourself to what you do in life.<\/p><p>Things are going so well for you, you may go head over heels trying to make left or right of them. Don't worry if all the sudden activity surrounding you leaves you feeling confused. Do what you feel is right and know that during this month, you are most visible this year. Get the most you can out of small compliments and capitalize on greater ones, unafraid to take what you want and deserve.<\/p>","taurus":"<p>This month will make you want to expand your horizons. You don't want to reach for the sky, you want to widen the vistas of your very existence. People around you at work will notice your all-encompassing attitude during this time and may work with you either to help you achieve your goals or to better their own positions. Your warmth and friendship at work will guarantee cooperation from others, regardless of their own agendas.<\/p><p>You will reach out to people in a variety of ways, either by one-on-one contact, a phone call, email or wall post. Your friendly hand will be met in kind and you can expect the people around you will do more than nothing at all to help you in your quest. This month will focus on your goals and you should become goal-oriented now if you were not before. There are things you need to do in order to advance your career and you know what those are; now take the steps needed to put you where you want to be. Your own agenda will be strangely lively during this time and you will have many meetings, gatherings or parties to attend. It is imperative you show up at these events and mingle with the people in your field. Because your energy for making contact with others is high during this time, it should not be a difficult thing to do.<\/p><p>This is the time to pursue your dreams, and use the people around you to help you get where you want to go. People may be willing to help you for some consideration in the future and you should not snub these offers without some thought. Plant seeds now to reap what you wish in the future.<\/p>","aries":"<p>During this month you will come to be more aware of your unique limitations and breaking points. It is a time of tests, yes, but do not fall into despair; though your awareness will be heightened up to and even following your birthday phase, the feelings of restriction or being confined are not going to last.<\/p><p>A sense or actual being of rivalry could come over you so keep your eyes on the people closest to you. This not only helps to add to your apprehensive attitude during this time but could get you into further trouble yet if you jump the gun. This is no time to go overboard or make large changes with likely large consequences. You can't solve the world's problems, even if you were able to help out someone in a department with some specific issue recently. Self-pity will do you no good during this time either. Perhaps the best advice for you during this month is to lay low and keep from standing out. Avoid any big meetings about budgets, spending or other monetary matters. If your voice is absolutely necessary to resolve a specific issue, say only what you need to say and don't leave what you say open to interpretation; clear, concise communication will save you from loads of trouble.<\/p><p>This is a time to make real efforts at getting along with others, both at work and in your personal life. The more people you can befriend and bring over to helping you in your endeavors, the fewer people you need to worry about working against you or trying to sabotage you. For your well-being as a whole, do not hesitate to extend an olive branch even to someone with whom you've been feuding.<\/p>"}}]}
